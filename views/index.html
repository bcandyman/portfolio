                                    But we’ve met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin’s, It used
                                    to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It’s an orphanage. My mum died when I was
                                    small, it was a car accident. I don’t remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years
                                    later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people
                                    know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The
                                    fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little
                                    kid to do something he knows he can’t do, move on. After a while they stop
                                    understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy’s home, I figured it out too late.
                                    Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It’s like
                                    putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your
                                    arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up
                                    stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that’s all it was,
                                    just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I’d seen that
                                    look on your face before. It’s the same one I taught myself. I don’t why you took
                                    the fault for Dent’s murder but I’m still a believer in the Batman. Even if you’re
                                    not…
                                </p>
